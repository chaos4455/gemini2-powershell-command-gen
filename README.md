## ✨ Overview

Gemini2 PowerShell Command Gen is a web application crafted to simplify and accelerate the creation of PowerShell commands. 🛠️ Powered by **Google's Gemini 2** language model and built with **Streamlit**, this tool offers an intuitive interface for generating efficient, detailed, and customized PowerShell scripts. It's designed to empower both newcomers and seasoned professionals to automate tasks with ease.

## 🎯 What It Does

This application harnesses the power of Google's **Gemini 2** to understand natural language descriptions and convert them into executable **PowerShell** code. 🤖 Users simply describe the task they need to automate, and the application generates the corresponding PowerShell code, factoring in various parameters set by the user.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This application was built using **Python**, and the following tools:

1.  **✍️ User Input:** Users start by describing their desired PowerShell command in a text field, specifying the automation task they need to accomplish.
2.  **🎛️ Parameter Configuration:** A sidebar allows users to fine-tune the command generation with various parameters:
    *   **🤖 AI Model:** Choose between available Gemini models for code generation.
    *   **🌡️ Temperature:** Adjust the randomness and creativity of the generated code.
    *   **📏 Max Tokens:** Set the maximum length of the generated output.
    *   **🎯 Prompt Presets:** Select from pre-defined examples to initiate common use cases.
    *   **🧐 Prompt Detail:** Choose the level of detail for the prompt generation.
    *   **🎛️ PowerShell Settings:** Specify the PowerShell version, OS, file encoding, and options for including headers and error handling.
    *   **🔍 Detail Level, ✍️ Script Type, and 🛡️ Security Level:** Adjust verbosity, interactivity, and the security focus of the generated scripts.
    *   **🗂️ Logging Level:** Define the level of logging detail included in the script.
3.  **🧠 Command Generation:** The application sends the user's description and selected parameters to the Gemini 2 model.
4.  **✅ Output & ⬇️ Download:** The generated **PowerShell** command is displayed in a code block, and users can download the code as a `.ps1` file.

## 💡 Benefits

This project provides several benefits to its users:

*   **⚡ Time Saving:** Generate complex PowerShell scripts in minutes, reducing time spent on writing code from scratch.
*   **📈 Increased Efficiency:** Create well-structured, optimized scripts that are ready for immediate use.
*   **✅ Improved Accuracy:** Minimize the risk of errors through AI-assisted code generation.
*   **🙌 Accessibility:** Lower the barrier for those new to PowerShell, enabling automation for a wider audience.
*   **🛠️ Customizable:** Adjust parameters to fine-tune the generated commands based on specific requirements.
*   **🔒 Best Practices:** Encourages the use of structured, robust, and secure PowerShell scripts.

## 🤔 Why I Created This Project

I created Gemini2 PowerShell Command Gen with the goal of accelerating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) adoption and promoting **PowerShell** for automating the management of Windows Server environments, including:

*   **🖥️ Windows Server (WS):** Automating tasks, configurations, and updates.
*   **🗂️ Active Directory (AD):** Managing users, groups, OUs, and policies.
*   **🪟 Terminal Services (TS):** Streamlining session and resource management.
*   **📁 File Servers (FS):** Automating file permissions, storage, and data integrity.
*   **🖨️ Print Servers (PS):** Managing printers, queues, and driver deployment.

I believe that simplifying **PowerShell** scripting makes it more accessible, empowering professionals to focus on innovation rather than repetitive tasks.

## 🎯 My Purpose

The main goal of this project is to democratize **PowerShell** usage and allow a wider audience to benefit from its automation capabilities. By making PowerShell command creation more straightforward, this application seeks to:

*   **🪜 Lower the Barrier to Entry:** Make automation accessible to individuals with varying levels of **PowerShell** experience.
*   **⚡ Increase Efficiency:** Enable experienced users to quickly generate complex scripts, saving time and effort.
*   **✅ Promote Best Practices:** Encourage the use of well-structured, robust, and efficient **PowerShell** scripts using AI-assisted code generation.
*   **🤝 Foster Community:** Promote sharing and collaboration within the **PowerShell** community.
